# SaferStreetsForGators
Pedestrian traffic crashes are preventable tragedies that plague the city of Gainesville. Safer Streets for Gators is a web mapping application that allows the community to report common traffic violations, such as speeding vehicles and running stop lights. The map is automatically updated with each new record. Users can view previous traffic reports as well as locations of pedestrian traffic crashes, as symbolized by different icons. Clicking these icons will give details of each incident. 

This map can be used to identify the most dangerous locations in Gainesville and potentially be used to find a solution. Areas with significant clustering of incidents can be analysed for potential contributing factors, such as accessibility of crosswalks, recent urban developments, and visibility of traffic signals. Traffic violation reports can be used to identify areas of interest in which we may want to have more traffic enforcement, i.e. police presence. Finally, by using community sourced data, the project hopes to empower the citizens of Gainsville to contribute to a safer city with the application.
